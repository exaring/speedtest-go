# LibreSpeed

No Flash, No Java, No WebSocket, No Bullshit.

This is a very lightweight speed test implemented in JavaScript, using XMLHttpRequest and Web Workers.

## Fork

This is a fork of the [original librespeed/speedtest-go](https://github.com/librespeed/speedtest-go) repo
with everything stripped except the frontend code, which has been adjusted.
